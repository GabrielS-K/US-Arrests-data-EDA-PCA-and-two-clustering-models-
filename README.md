# US-Arrests-data-EDA-PCA-and-two-clustering-models-
A Jupyter notebook file containing a data analysis of the UsArrests.csv file, which is comprised of data about the number of arrests per 100,000 residents for a number of different crimes in each state, as well as the percentage of the population living in urban areas.
PCA is performed on the data for dimensional reduction and the data is fit to two different clustering models: an agglomerative one (visualised with dendrograms) and a k-means one (visualised on a scatter plot of the two main principle components)
